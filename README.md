# Predicting_Stock_Prices
A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LSTM, ARIMA, XGBOOST ALGORITHMS, HYPERPARAMETER TUNING AND ENSEMBLING METHODS
This research report presents a comprehensive investigation into the prediction of Google's stock prices using advanced machine-learning techniques. The study focuses on assessing the predictive capabilities of three distinct algorithms: Xgboost, LSTM, and ARIMA, applied to historical stock price data with a specific emphasis on close prices. 
The study explores the data and delves into the realm of feature selection, a significant aspect that aims to discern the relevance of variables in the context of constructing multivariate models. Through this process, it becomes apparent that certain calculated or adjusted metrics hold minimal importance and are likely redundant for multivariate models. Notably, the study identifies the most influential features as close, high, open, and low prices, underscoring their impact on enhancing the predictive accuracy of the models. 
The primary goal is to develop accurate univariate models to forecast the closing stock price for the next day, a crucial aspect of financial decision-making. The evaluation of model performance utilizes a range of metrics including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to provide insights into predictive accuracy. 
Furthermore, the study explores the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods in optimizing model performance. The findings highlight the strong performance of the Xgboost model, which achieves a notable R-squared value and effectively minimizes error metrics. While ensemble techniques exhibit potential, they do not consistently outperform all individual models. The subsequent hyperparameter tuning of the Xgboost algorithm achieves a higher R-squared value of 99.47%, accompanied by a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 15.98 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 27.34.
This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of machine learning for stock price prediction, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful model selection and parameter optimization. It acknowledges the intricate and dynamic nature of financial markets and suggests promising avenues for future research and innovation within this domain.
